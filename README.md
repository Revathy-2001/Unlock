# Unlock

This project is related to motion of ball main logic is to get the key to unlock as and when the game starts the first step is to move to ball using moving jestures which is available when we start the game the ball need to go through the second block from first to reach the third block for picking the key to unlock which is at the beginning position itself 

While passing through the blocks there will be hurdles in between to disturb the smooth move of easy going of the ball  to give a jerk to the game atlast after picking the key we need to pass in same opposite direction to reach the beginning where there is the lock
